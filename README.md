## Usage Example
When prompted, enter a string "Alice":
Enter your name: Alice
Hello, Alice!

##Issue
Issue:
Initially, the program allowed users to input empty strings (just pressing "Enter") and would not provide any feedback. This was confusing for users as they werenâ€™t notified when their input was invalid.

Resolution:
We added a check to ensure that if the user does not enter any name (presses "Enter" without typing anything), the program outputs an error message:

"Error: Name cannot be empty! Please try again."
